# Project Proposal: Eco Eats

## What and Why?
A platform to help anyone access less conventional, more affordable and eco-friedly resources for their grocery needs. This includes farmer's markets, delivery programs, food pantries, community gardens, co-op's, or any small business shadowed by major super markets. This is based on the belief that food should be within reach of every person, and not monopolized by big businesses that oscillate prices in exploitation of those who rely on them. 

## For Whom?
For anyone who wants to change how they satisfy their regular dietary needs, but especially for those in food deserts or low income areas who are barred from accessing healthy, affordable groceries.

## How?
A database system is maintained of qualifying destinations, either reported by the business themselves or found through research. GPS technology is used to locate the nearest option for the user, much like other map-based apps do. The user can also browse through all options, as filtered by distance or other characteristics, in order to find what is most convinient to them. Details regarding each location includes price range (using the '$' system), hours of operation, whether membership or application is required to participate (more relevant to community gardens and pantries), and availability of items.
